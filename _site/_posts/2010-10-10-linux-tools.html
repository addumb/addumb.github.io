<p>I've gotten tired of re-writing small command-line tools that are missing from most Linux distributions. Too often I've found myself trying to pipe through a command that calculates the average or standard deviation of a text file. I re-write the same awk lines over and over to get a distribution of certain columns of log files (like nginx HTTP status codes or of the document size sent).</p>
<p>I know these tools have been written over and over by many many people. The ones I've found have been either subject specific (e.g. generate a sideways ASCII histogram from a log file, which is <b>really super sweet and useful</b>, but not always what I'm looking for) or too all-in-one to satisfy my need for a more tool-chainy way to do things. This is 90% for myself, so I don't have to re-write these over and over. I put them up on github so I can just clone the tools wherever I want to use them. It'd be great if other people found these tools useful, and maybe even wrote some more :)</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: So far these are basically wrappers around awk. That's mostly because awk is the awesomest tool in the whole world. Also, it's because I've been dealing with a lot of text processing lately at work. I have dreams of many other tools, but none concrete enough to start writing them.</p>
<p>Cross-post from <a href="http://github.com/addumb/tools/blob/master/README.md">http://github.com/addumb/tools/blob/master/README.md</a>:</p>
<h2>avg</h2>
<p>Spit out the average of a column in a text file</p>
<h2>stddev</h2>
<p>Spit out the standard deviation of a column in a text file</p>
<h2>column-bin</h2>
<p>bin the columns of a text file (VERY useful for quick summaries of apache HTTP status codes and the like)</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p><code><br />
 $ cat test.csv<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 1024<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 1024<br />
	log HTTP status: 500 body_size: 0<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 10000<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 409 body_size: 10<br />
 $ column-bin -c 4 &lt; test.csv<br />
	409	1<br />
	400	3<br />
	200	3<br />
	500	1<br />
</code></p>
<h2>column-histogram</h2>
<p>Similar to column-bin, but for continuous variables. Bin the column into bins of a fixed size OR bin them into log-based sizes to make either a histogram or a semi-log histogram.</p>
<h3>Usage:</h3>
<p><code><br />
 $ cat test.csv<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 1024<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 1024<br />
	log HTTP status: 500 body_size: 0<br />
	log HTTP status: 200 body_size: 10000<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 400 body_size: 10<br />
	log HTTP status: 409 body_size: 10<br />
 $ column-histogram -c 6 -b 1000 &lt; test.csv<br />
	10000	1<br />
	0	5<br />
	1000	2<br />
 $ column-histogram -c 6 -L 10 &lt; test.csv<br />
	10000	1<br />
	0	1<br />
	10	4<br />
	1000	2<br />
</code></p>
