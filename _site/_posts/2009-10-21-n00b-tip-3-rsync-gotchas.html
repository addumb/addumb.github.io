<p>Use rsync a lot? Do you use it just infrequently enough to have to check the man page every time? Me too. I always have trouble with out it interprets trailing slashes on paths.</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy entire directory to remote parent directory:<br />
<code>rsync /path/without/slash host:/path/to/parent/with/slash/</code></li>
<li>Copy contents of one directory to another:<br />
<code>rsync -r /path/to/directory/* host:/path/to/directory/</code></li>
<li>Copy a directory into a <b>new</b> directory on another host:<br />
<code>rsync /path/without/slash host:/path/to/new/directory</code></li>
<p>One more thing, I almost always use -aP, but for some high-latency connections you'll probably also want to pass -z for compressing the stream.</ol>
