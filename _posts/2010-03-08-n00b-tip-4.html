<p>Bash history can be a lifesaver, but when you need it, you usually also need to know <strong>when</strong> the commands were run. To do this, put the following line in your <em>~/.bashrc</em><br />
<code>export HISTTIMEFORMAT="[%x %X] "</code><br />
This tells bash to prepend lines to .bash_history with the timestamp (commented) so when you run <em>history</em>, the timestamps get pulled in alongside the commands.</p>
