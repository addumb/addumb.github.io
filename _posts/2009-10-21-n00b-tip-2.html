<p>bash's built-in `read` may behave unexpectedly. I'm not sure exactly why, but it looks like it has to do with it expecting to be invoked in a loop. Here's what I expected to work:<br />
<code><br />
$ echo "thisisfirst thisissecond" | read first second<br />
$ echo $first</p>
<p>$ echo $second</p>
<p></code><br />
Wait, what? But I use read all the time for while loops like this:<br />
<code><br />
cat file | while read col1 col2 col3; do<br />
    printf "col1: %sncol2: %sncol3: %snn" $col1 $col2 $col3<br />
done<br />
</code><br />
and that has never let me down. So why can't I do it this way? <b>I don't really know, do you?</b> Here's a work around:<br />
<code><br />
echo "thisisfirst thisissecond" | while read first second; do<br />
#do junk here<br />
done<br />
</code></p>
