<p>I use a desktop plus a laptop at work. My desktop is running Ubuntu, and my laptop is running OS X (MacBook Pro). I started to use <a href="http://synergy-foss.org/">synergy</a> right off the bat. Eventually I got tired of having to move my mouse across the screens to change the focus, so I added this to my ~/.synergy.conf:<br />
<pre>
section: options
  keystroke(alt+super+l) = switchInDirection(right)
  keystroke(alt+super+h) = switchInDirection(left)
end
</pre><br />
And I was happy for a while! I started to use <a href="http://www.tenshu.net/terminator/">terminator</a> because I always had 4+ gnome-terminal sessions open at once and wanted to see them all (tabs only took me so far). Sad thing is, I could never get the terminator navigation keys to work predictably. If I had 4 terminals open at once, alt+direction never behaved how I expected.</p>
<p>So I gave a tiling window manager a try: <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a>. It's... well it's awesome. It gets REALLY weird if you have a bunch of modal windows though, so be careful running Ubuntu's update manager or such.</p>
<p>But there was a problem! I have two monitors on my desktop, which awesome understands as two screens. Perfect! That's what I hoped for. Switching back and forth between the screens with mod4+control+j or k moves the mouse cursor to 0,0 (top left corner) of each screen. Synergy interprets that as its cue to switch screens, so when I move to 0,0 on my left monitor, synergy moves the focus over to my laptop (to the left of both monitors). Crap. Then I have to hit mod4+alt+l (that's L) to get to my desktop again, so I could never easily move from my right monitor back to my left monitor because it would always trip over to my laptop (leftmost screen).</p>
<p>The was super simple, though. Found it in a mailing list, of course. Add this to ~/.synergy.conf:<br />
<pre>
section: options
  switchCorners = top-left
  switchCornerSize = 2
end
</pre>
That makes synergy not switch screens when the mouse is over a two-pixel cross in the top-left corner. Now I can switch screens within awesome and within synergy! So much less mouse needed!</p>
<p>Update: How do you set up awesome and synergy? Oh, glad you asked! I'm running Ubuntu 10.something-ish, so I did this to set up awesome:<br />
<pre>
$ sudo apt-get install awesome
$ gnome-session-properties
</pre>
Then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncheck your window manager (metacity or compiz?)</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
<li>Enter "awesome" or really anything you like for the Name</li>
<li>Enter "awesome" for the Command</li>
<li>Optionally fill in a comment</li>
<li>Click Add</li>
<li>Log out and back in!</li>
</ol>
