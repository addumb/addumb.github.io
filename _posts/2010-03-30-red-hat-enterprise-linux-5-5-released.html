<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5 was released today. Nobody knows why. There is almost nothing new in the release notes: <a href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.5/html-single/Release_Notes/">http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5.5/html-single/Release_Notes/ </a></p>
