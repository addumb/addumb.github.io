If a server says it's low on disk space but you can't find the offending file(s), try checking the output of lsof for "(deleted)". Some services out there really really hate it when you poorly rotate logs and delete the old ones from under them.

Check free space:

    [root@server ~]# df -h
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1              65G   52G  9.6G  85% /
    tmpfs                 2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm

Grasping at straws, check lsof:

    [root@server ~]# lsof -p 2586 | grep "(deleted)"
    lighttpd 2586 lighttpd    6w   REG    8,1    33973933 7548243 /var/log/lighttpd/someotheraccesslog (deleted)<br />
    /etc/init.d/lighttpd restart

Check fix:

    [root@server ~]# df -h
    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1              65G   16G   46G  26% /
    tmpfs                 2.0G     0  2.0G   0% /dev/shm

All done!
