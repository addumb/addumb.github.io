bash's built-in `read` may behave unexpectedly. I'm not sure exactly why, but it looks like it has to do with it expecting to be invoked in a loop. Here's what I expected to work:

    $ echo "thisisfirst thisissecond" | read first second
    $ echo $first
    $ echo $second

Wait, what? But I use read all the time for while loops like this:

    cat file | while read col1 col2 col3; do
        printf "col1: %sncol2: %sncol3: %snn" $col1 $col2 $col3
    done

and that has never let me down. So why can't I do it this way? I don't really know, do you? Here's a work around:

    echo "thisisfirst thisissecond" | while read first second; do
        #do junk here
    done
