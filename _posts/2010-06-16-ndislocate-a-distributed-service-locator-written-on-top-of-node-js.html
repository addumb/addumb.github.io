<p>This looks pretty cool! My coworker, Vijay (<a href="http://github.com/lukatmyshu">http://github.com/lukatmyshu</a>),  showed me this. Built on node.js. A simple distributed service locator. Well... a service locator service. Like a factory factory? Whatever, I want to check it out...<br />
<code><br />
git clone git://github.com/ry/node<br />
cd node<br />
#WARNING: it didn't pick up my libevent properly,... whatever though, I'm just seein' how it works<br />
./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install<br />
cd ..<br />
git clone git://github.com/pquerna/ndislocate<br />
cd ndislocate<br />
echo "{ }" &gt; test.json<br />
./ndislocate.js this_isnt_even_read_so_why_bother_requiring_a_third_param<br />
</code><br />
Voila! It told me that it found my local HTTP, HTTPS and SSH servers. I'll fiddle more tomorrow, I suppose.</p>
